# Task ID: 12
# Title: Implement User Session Management
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2
# Priority: low
# Description: Add basic session management for the single anonymous user.
# Details:
Use Flask-Session 0.5.0 to manage server-side sessions. Implement a mechanism to associate uploaded and generated images with the current session. Ensure that users can only access their own images. Clear session data and associated images after a period of inactivity.

# Test Strategy:
Test session creation and expiration. Verify that users can only access their own images. Test behavior when switching between multiple browser tabs.
