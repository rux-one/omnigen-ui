# Title: Develop Main Application Interface
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 3, 4, 5, 7, 8
# Priority: high
# Description: Create the main application interface integrating all components.
# Details:
Design and implement the main Vue component. Use Vue Router 4.2.2 for navigation. Implement a responsive layout using Vuetify 3.3.3. Ensure all components (image upload, parameter configuration, progress tracking, image listing) are properly integrated and communicate effectively.

# Test Strategy:
Conduct end-to-end testing of the entire application flow. Verify that all components interact correctly. Test responsiveness across different screen sizes.
