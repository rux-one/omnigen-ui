# Task ID: 11
# Title: Optimize Image Processing and Storage
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 3, 4
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement efficient image processing and storage mechanisms.
# Details:
Use Pillow 9.5.0 for image processing in the backend. Implement image resizing for thumbnails. Use a caching mechanism (e.g., Flask-Caching 2.0.2) to store processed images. Implement lazy loading of images in the frontend. Consider implementing image compression if needed.

# Test Strategy:
Test image processing with various image types and sizes. Measure and compare load times with and without optimizations. Verify that image quality is maintained after processing.
