# Task ID: 8
# Title: Implement Script Cancellation Feature
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 6, 7
# Priority: medium
# Description: Add functionality to cancel the bash script execution.
# Details:
Create an API endpoint for script cancellation. Use Python's multiprocessing module to manage script execution in a separate process. Implement a mechanism to terminate the process when cancellation is requested. Update the frontend to include a cancellation button in the progress tracking component.

# Test Strategy:
Test cancellation at various stages of script execution. Ensure resources are properly cleaned up after cancellation. Verify that the UI correctly reflects the cancelled state.
