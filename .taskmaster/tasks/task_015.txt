# Task ID: 15
# Title: Perform Security Audit and Optimization
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1, 2, 3, 6, 12
# Priority: high
# Description: Conduct a security audit of the application and implement necessary security measures.
# Details:
Use Flask-Talisman 1.0.0 to set security headers. Implement input validation and sanitization using cerberus 1.3.4. Use Flask-Limiter 3.3.1 for rate limiting. Ensure all user inputs are properly escaped to prevent XSS attacks. Use python-dotenv 1.0.0 to manage environment variables for sensitive information.

# Test Strategy:
Conduct penetration testing using tools like OWASP ZAP. Verify that all security headers are correctly set. Test rate limiting functionality. Attempt common attack vectors (XSS, CSRF, etc.) and ensure they are mitigated.
