# Task ID: 14
# Title: Implement Logging and Monitoring
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 9, 10
# Priority: low
# Description: Set up a logging and monitoring system for both frontend and backend.
# Details:
Use Python's logging module for backend logging. Implement log rotation using RotatingFileHandler. For frontend logging, use vue-logger-plugin 2.2.3. Set up Sentry 1.21.1 for error tracking and performance monitoring in both frontend and backend.

# Test Strategy:
Verify that logs are correctly generated and rotated. Test Sentry integration by triggering various error scenarios. Ensure that sensitive information is not logged.
